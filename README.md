# CISC/CMPE 204 Modelling Project

Our project should be run out of run.py, it will ask you to position your pawns, then give you our solutions.

For more information on hexapawn, read our modelling_document.docx!

Finally, to simplify the code we seperated our project into two theories, one for counting called possible_moves_theory() and one for checking wins as the original example_theory().

## Structure

* `documents`: Contains folders for both of your draft and final submissions. README.md files are included in both.
* `run.py`: General wrapper script that you can choose to use or not. Only requirement is that you implement the one function inside of there for the auto-checks.
* `test.py`: Run this file to confirm that your submission has everything required. This essentially just means it will check for the right files and sufficient theory size.
